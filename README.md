Keeps track of topics in the news and analyzes when something is a trending topic.

## Interactions

There are several ways to interact with the service. It should be able to accept requests as well as trigger messages in various ways. I want this to be able to run in the background and alert me when there are new trends in news. I also want to be able to identify new sources for news, the app may also scan for potential new sources and then automatically monitors them or ask if they should be scanned.

 - UI: Customization options via a UI somehow.
 - Twitter: This should be able to tweet out when a topic is trending on news sources.
 - Email: Sending an email with a news source would trigger that site for scanning.

## Tracking

Scans known websites for updates or new articles and keeps track of the content recognizing trends and topics.

## Language

Note to self: I should write this in io.
